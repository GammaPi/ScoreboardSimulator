# Ver 1.0 (Work In Progress, Please change)

## Expectations

The goal of version 1.0 is to meet the minimum course requirement. Remeber, the goal of this project is to show our understanding of scoreboarding. We should only implement necessary functions and all related functions as simple as possible.

## Definition

### Hardware
No pipeline
Integer Adder *2
Float Adder *1
Float Multipier *1
A stack

The hardware is fixd & unconfigurable.

### Instruction Set

ADDI
SUBI
ADDD
SUBD
MULD
LD
ST
BNZ
JUMP


### Input Format

Input should be defined strictly in the format of Op R1,R2,R3
eg:
```
  ADDI R1,R2,R3 // R1=R2+R3
  LD R1,53,R2 //[R1]=R2+53
```

### Output Format

Final Scoreboarding Instruction Status Table (In Console)

Final Scoreboarding Register Status Table (In Console)

Final Scoreboarding Register Status Table (In Console)

Final memory Dump (In Console)

Final Registers Dump (In Console)

Final Stack Dump (In Console)
